# INCF-Impact-visualization-Portal

The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing neuroscience and neuroinformatics. Their mission involves promoting open, fair, and easily citable standards while providing support to researchers worldwide. INCF's projects encompass a wide range of areas, from predicting Alzheimer's and detecting cancer cells to mapping the brain in 3D, developing connectomes, and analyzing EEG data. Given this extensive and impactful work, there is a pressing need for an online portal to effectively track INCF's progress and showcase its global contributions using simple language. This portal is thoughtfully designed to make INCF's achievements accessible to a broad audience, regardless of their familiarity with technical terminology. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models and Langchain, a comprehensive dashboard is created. This user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing platform serves to highlight research progress and the real-world impact on people's lives. It aims at ultimately raising awareness about the field of neuroinformatics and INCF's pivotal role in advancing neuroscience.
